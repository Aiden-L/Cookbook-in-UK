Inspired by @Anduin2017 and a great experience spending dinners with Cyber Security Bad Guys, we are happy to create this project to share our receipes.

The dishes included in the project are already appeared in our dinner table.

## Notes

1. The cooking environment is based on Lancaster University Graduate College Superior Ensuite kitchen. You might need to adjust slightly some steps if you are in a different environment (mostly heat).
2. Cooking needs great attention, do not leave your food cooking without any reminders.
